# Portfolio

## Description:

This website is my second project for my portfolio on https://mees100.github.io/. I rewrote my website in TypeScript and used vite.

I still continue to improve it.

On this website I share some information about myself and also want to show my skills.

You can run the website on your machine with `npm run dev`
